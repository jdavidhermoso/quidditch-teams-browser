# quidditchTeamsBrowser
## Quidditch webapp  that wants to be a gallery of all the spanish Quidditch teams.

## Notice
This is a legacy app I built this app when I was a junior developer in 2017 with BackboneJS and PHP, Mysql and Apache (LAMP) environment to list and show on a map all the Quidditch teams of the world. It was working for 3 years with more than 60 teams signed up. It finally went offline, but I'm proud of the project. It was challenging for me at that time, and I learned a lot from the following list of concepts or tools:

1. HTML, CSS, and Vanilla Javascript with BackboneJS: It was great to learn how to build a frontend app using vanilla and backbone, which was innovative at that time. I coded a lot of HTML and CSS to build the UI, so I could face many challenges.

2. Rest API: I learned about the Rest methods, headers, how to interact with it from the FE side, etc.

3. Php: I learned how to set up a Rest API with Php, split into classes to make code modular, make small components, etc.

4. MySql: I spent many hours learning how to set up a DB with MySql, querying all the data I needed

MVC (Model-View-Controller): I adquire knowledge of what was MVC and why I need it both in the frontend side and the backend side.

5. GIT: I walked my first steps with GIT. I made mistakes, but that was super useful for a later integration in big development teams.

6. Last, but not least, I have a lot of fun and I made a huge amount of pair programming hours with my best friend.
